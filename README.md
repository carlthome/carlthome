### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm focused on machine learning and music technology. My primary interest in life is music and I'm a music information retrieval (MIR) enthusiast. I love digital signal processing (DSP) but I'm particularly interested in associative memory for artificial neural networks (ANNs). My current love is _differentiable programming_ and _self-supervised learning_. **Automatic differentiation go brrr.**

### Some personal beliefs
- I think scientific knowledge should be accessible to everyone.
- I think engineering is an artistic craft that deserves practice.
- I think free software alternatives are important for a society.
- I think everyone can learn mathematics if it's taught right.
- I think formalisms are fun but secondary to intuition.
- I think following personal interests is more important than having a career.
