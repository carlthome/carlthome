### Welcome to my GitHub.com profile! üëã
My name is Carl Thom√©. I'm a computer scientist focused on machine learning and music technology. My primary interest in life is music and I'm a music information retrieval (MIR) enthusiast. I love digital signal processing (DSP) but I'm particularly interested in associative memory for artificial neural networks (ANNs). My current love is _differentiable programming_ and _self-supervised learning_. I mistakingly think I'd like to learn category theory. **Automatic differentiation go brrr.**

#### ü§î Some personal beliefs
- Scientific knowledge should be accessible to everyone.
- Engineering is an artistic craft that deserves practice.
- Free software alternatives are important for a society.
- Everyone can learn mathematics if it's taught right.
- Working together goes further than competing.
- Prestige kills creativity.
- Formalisms are fun but secondary to intuition.
- Following interests is more important than having a career.

#### üç≠ A little bit of gamification
